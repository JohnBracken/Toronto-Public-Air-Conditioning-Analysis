The following SQL script performs a few summaries and analyses of public air
conditioned location data in the City of Toronto.  The data was taken from the City
of Toronto website and is publicly available.  In particular, SQL is really
helpful for categorizing how many of each classification of air conditioned location
is available.  Libraries in particular are prevalent public locations with air 
conditioning.  This code was tested and verified using MySQL on a local database 
connection set up on a stand alone PC.
